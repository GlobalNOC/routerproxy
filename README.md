## About
Router Proxy is a web-based perl-driven management tool specifically designed for Cisco,
Juniper, and several TL1-based devices.  Command output may be retrieved from the remote
device in its raw form, or if supported (Juniper and TL1 devices) an easy to read tabular form
using the available menu commands.  Both telnet and SSH protocols are supported, as well as
JUNOScript for Juniper devices.  Router Proxy requires Javascript to be enabled and utilizes
AJAX technology to send and receive command input/output.

## Installation
*IMPORTANT* First and foremost, you will almost certainly want to configure Apache to have an
alias for each Router Proxy supported pointing to the webroot folder of Router Proxy. 

Router Proxy itself must be configured.  An example configuration file (config.xml) is provided in the
/etc/grnoc/routerproxy/ with instances for every supported device.  Enabled commands are also
specified for every type of device--users may only issue commands with these prefixes.  You
can add or remove commands as you wish.

Starting from version 1.7.4, the location of the configuration file for each Router Proxy
is acquired by mapping with the url using the mappings file named routerproxy_mappings.xml. 
An example is provided in /etc/grnoc/routerproxy/. The absolute paths must be used for the mapping and 
shouldn't be in a web accessible folder for all to see. This would easily allow someone to 
discover all of the passwords to the devices you have configured for your Router Proxy installation.

If you wish to change the appearance of Router Proxy, feel free to edit the webroot/style.css
cascading style sheet to better suit your needs.

## Dependencies
Router Proxy needs an Apache installation with CGI/Perl support.  Additionally the following
Perl modules need to be installed as well (generally easily done with cpan).

* JUNOS::Device (see http://www.juniper.net/support/xml/junoscript/index.html)
(NOTE: This is now only required for the menu based commands.. if you
don't have it installed, RouterProxy will still work)
* CGI
* CGI::Ajax
* XML::Simple
* Encode
* Expect
* Time::ParseDate
* Date::Calc

**NOTE** JUNOS::Device depends upon several modules itself--which can sometimes be fun to try
and install all of them.  In particular, if you have trouble installing Math::GMP make
sure your have libgmp installed, available at: http://www.swox.com/gmp/.

You will also need to manually install the GRNOC::TL1 module, placing it in a proper lib
directory on your machine.

These modules have several dependencies of their own, so make sure they are installed as well.

## TODO
* IOS Menu Commands?
* Force10 Menu Commands?
* HP Menu Commands?
* Telnet support for IOS XR, Force10, HP (currently does not work)
